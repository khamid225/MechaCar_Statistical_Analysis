The results of the regression model can be found below. It can be seen that the variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance are positive and significant at the .05 significance level. The other variables in the model are insignificant at the 95% confidence level. The overall model is significant as the p-value of the model is less than .05 and the F-statistic is 22.07. The R2 value is .7149. This indicates that 71.49% of the variance of mpg is explained by the variables in the model, before adjusting for the degrees of freedom, and 68.25% of the variance of mpg is explained after adjusting for the degrees of freedom. Given the large R2 value, it seems that much of the variance of mpg is explained by the variables in the model and there is very little omitted variable bias. In sum, it can be concluded that vehicle length and ground clearance are significant predictors of mpg.
