The results of the regression model can be found below. It can be seen that the variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance are positive and significant at the .05 significance level. The other variables in the model are insignificant at the 95% confidence level. The overall model is significant as the p-value of the model is less than .05 and the F-statistic is 22.07. The R2 value is .7149. This indicates that 71.49% of the variance of mpg is explained by the variables in the model, before adjusting for the degrees of freedom, and 68.25% of the variance of mpg is explained after adjusting for the degrees of freedom. Given the large R2 value, it seems that much of the variance of mpg is explained by the variables in the model and there is very little omitted variable bias. In sum, it can be concluded that vehicle length and ground clearance are significant predictors of mpg.

The summary results of pounds per square inch (PSI) for the Suspension Coil data can be seen below. The average PSI is 1499, the median is 1500, the variance is 62.3, and the Standard Deviation is 7.89. The same statistics are also broken down by lot in the second table. The second table demonstrates that the variance of the suspension coils for Lot 3 exceeds 100 pounds per square inch, but not for the first two lots.

The results of the ttest for the full sample is presented below. It can be seen that the p-value is above .05, we therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the sample mean PSI, which is 1498.78, is not statistically significantly different from the population mean of 1500 PSI.

The results of the ttest for Lot 1 are presented below. Here again we fail to reject the null and conclude that the sample mean PSI for Lot 1 is not statistically significantly different from the population mean of 1500 PSI.

The results of the ttest for Lot 2 are presented below. Here again we fail to reject the null and conclude that the sample mean PSI for Lot 2 is not statistically significantly different from the population mean of 1500 PSI.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81202523/133706483-ce11d350-fb6f-4df5-b31d-3c6d6431e1d7.png)
